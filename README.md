# Custom Homepage

This homepage app is designed to replace the "New Tab" page, and is heavily
inspired from the [MomentumDash](https://momentumdash.com/) Chrome extension.
It features customizable features that should integrate easily into everyday use.

Originally created as a learning experience and gift for private use. Images have
been replaced by free-to-use images on [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/).

Disclaimer: This app was created specifically for Google Chrome, and was not
designed with browser compatibility in mind (sorry!). It should somewhat work on
most modern browsers.

## How to Use

You can simply use the GitHub pages version (which does not allow for customization)
by going [here](https://drakonkinst.github.io/custom-homepage/) or download this folder. To set it as your homepage
in Chrome, you can copypaste the local URL of newtab.html in chrome://settings/
(Chrome Settings) under Appearance -> Show home button. To set it to your
New Tab page, you'll need an extension such as [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) and link it
to your local newtab.html file again.

## Features

- **Rotating Wallpaper**: Customizable wallpaper that rotates daily. Images can be customized in Settings, and new images can be added by downloading them to the `resources` folder then adding the file names to `user-config.js`.

- **Search Bar**: Googles whatever you put in. Goes to a website instead if you paste in a website URL.

- **Quotes**: A collection of 200+ quotes I've pulled together from over 20 fandoms. You can customize your feed and add your own quotes in Settings.

- **To-do List**: A simple to-do list where you can add, check, edit, and delete items.

- **Notes**: A plaintext note-taking app for all your documenting needs. Notes you've added can be locked, hidden, copied, and even downloaded.

- **Settings**: A wide variety of options to customize your homepage. Most elements can appear or disappear at will, and there are many other options such as choosing a background, viewing previous quotes, customizing note-taking shortcuts, and more.
